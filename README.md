This small extension adds a customer header to each HTTP request. 
Just add the manifest.json and rules.json files in a folder on your desktop. 

To add the extension to Chrome do the following: 

- Make sure you have both manifest.json and rules.json in the same directory.
- Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
- Enable "Developer mode" at the top right.
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing your extension files.
- The extension should now be loaded, and the custom header should be added to all HTTP requests.
